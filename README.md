# Macro Tracker  

**Tired of features locked behind a paywall? Build your own!** 

This app is my take on a MyFitnessPal-inspired macro tracker, designed to track your daily calories and macronutrient goals without subscriptions or limitations.

## Purpose  
MyFitnessPal’s once-free features are now behind a paywall, so I decided to make my own macro tracker. It’s simple, customizable, and open-source for anyone who wants to stay on top of their nutrition goals without the hassle.

## Features  
- Set Calorie & Macro Goals: Customize daily targets for carbs, protein, and fats.
- Food Logging: Manually add food items and their nutritional values to track your intake.
- Real-time Macro Tracking: Get a daily breakdown of consumed vs. remaining macros.
- Firestore Integration: Your data is saved in a Firestore database for seamless updates and persistence.
- Simple UI: Clean and responsive design to keep things user-friendly.

## Planned Features
- Searchable Food Database: Quickly find and log foods you've added.
- Recipe Builder: Calculate macros for recipes and save them for future use.
- Dynamic Suggestions: AI-powered meal suggestions based on your remaining macros.
